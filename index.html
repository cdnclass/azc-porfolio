<h1>The journey to the cloud</h1>

<p>I am currently re-skill my knowledge on the Cloud technology, I have just completed a boot camp training in Microsoft Azure as a Cloud Practitioner. I also interest in learning more about data science, machine learning and security - this is my life long ambition. 



In the past, I have done graphic design and website design, sale and freelancing. I have many years of experience in these fields.



I enjoy listening and making music in my spare time, I also love travelling and doing electronics experiment when I have time. Recently, I also have a new hobby in 3d printing.
